# Password Generator

Do you want a safe password? One that won't be easily cracked? And hasn't been already cracked? Well this is the python program for you!
This program will give you the option of inputting a phrase, and selecting a password length. From there it will generate a safe password
using a more secure version of the phrase, and add/remove characters to make it the desired length. It will tell you if the password generated is safe or not for you to use.
